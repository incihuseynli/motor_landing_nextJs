## Technologies that I used for this project

### Next JS

[Next](https://nextjs.org/) The React Framework for the Web. Used by some of the world's largest companies, Next.js enables you to create high-quality web applications with the power of React components. To create and install environment for Next JS I used Vite front end tool.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### TypeScript for Next

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

### Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a platform-agnostic frontend tool for building web applications quickly and solves some common developer headaches.


### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework. To configuration it comes as a choice when running code for create nextjs app.
